# Speedometer  
> A practical app to measure the real speed of 7 sorting algorithms.

## Instructions 
* Double click the Speedometer.jar and follow the instructions.

## Description
The data files represent a polygon shapes with height, area and volume. These will be read and converted into polygon objects. <br>
These objects implement the comparable interface in order to be ranked by my algorithm implementations.

### File Size 
* polyfor1 - 20,237 polygons.
* polyfor2 - 472,956 polygons.
* polyfor3 - 1,078,499 polygons.
* Files are only inside the jar**

### Algorithms 
1. Quick sort
2. Merge sort
3. Heap sort
4. Java sort\*\*
5. Insertion sort
6. Selection sort
7. Bubble sort
##### \*\* My implementation of the doSort() algorithm in Java JDK

## WARNING!
* Only use polyfor1 to measure: Insertion, Selection, Bubble, and Java sorts.<br>
The other files are too big for these algorithms.
